The definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a subject of debate. Artificial Intelligence typically refers to a machine's ability to "think" or perform functions that typically depend on human-like intelligence. In the broadest sense, AI is any computational process designed to mimic a human behaviors that require a response to an external stimulus. 



### History

The first true instance of AI is arguable, with some determining the mechanism used to produce *Ars generalis ultima* (The Ultimate General Art), published by [Ramon Llull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull) in 1308 was an artificial intelligence with the mechanical means to create new knowledge from logic and complex mechanical techniques.

In 1914, Spanish engineer [Leonardo Torres y Quevedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Torres_y_Quevedo) demonstrates the first chess-playing machine in Paris, capable of receiving information about a chess game and playing a king and rook endgame against king from any position without the aid of human intervention.

In 1950, [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) publishes *Computing Machinery and Intelligence*, introducing with it the concept of the "imitation game". This would later be known as the Turing Test, which tests a machine's ability to display behavior and produce output that is indistinguishable from that of an adult person.

The years ranging from 1956-1974 are considered the renaissance period of artificial intelligence with developments such as semantic nets, allowing machines to solve algebra word problems, and search algorithms that allowed machines to approach solving problems much like solving a maze.

Following this period the field of AI experienced a sequence of years in lulls and bursts in progress between the years 1974 and 2011 where computing power and amounts of available data would be considerable bottlenecks. This period ends around 2011 where the advents of machine learning and deep learning have demonstrated great leaps in the field, producing agents such as [Deep Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)) and [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo), computer programs that are able to beat some of the best human board game players in the world.

### Ethics

The ethical implications of artificial intelligence have been explored in philosophy, industry, and culture. Current leaders in AI research with ethics in mind often follow charters that promote inclusion and safety for humanity.
